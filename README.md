## About

LinkSquad was born at Ironhack Madrid when Web Designer [Irene Pulido](https://www.linkedin.com/in/irene-pulido-soto/) coined the idea for her UX/UI bootcamp's final project

Afterwards, Web Developers [Tomás Loroño](https://www.github.com/TL-Garcia) and [Román Baos](https://www.github.com/Pumpelgit) joined the effort (also Ironhack alumni) to turn Irene's design and storyboard into a fully fledged web app

Currently we are developing **LinkSquad** as a personal project, determined to push as many of our desired features as possible. We welcome any kind of input or collaboration :smile:
